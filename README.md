# Arcade
Arcade is a gaming platform: a program that lets the user choose a game to play and keeps a register of player scores.
Create your own clone of famous games. Your project should comply with a structure that separates the heart of your game launcher and its graphic dependencies.
You should dynamically load them with the help of the dl library.

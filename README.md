# Arcade
Arcade is a gaming platform: a program that lets the user choose a game to play and keeps a register of player scores.
Create your own clone of famous games. Your project should comply with a structure that separates the heart of your game launcher and its graphic dependencies.
You should dynamically load them with the help of the dl library.

## Before continuing...

This project is an EPITECH Project. If you are an EPITECH student, move out the way!

Nothing to see here... I don't want to be involved to your -42.

If you're not, no worries! You're welcome here!

### Prerequisites

To use this project, you'll need a compiler that supports C++ 20 and Criterion for the unit tests.

* [Criterion Installation](https://criterion.readthedocs.io/en/master/setup.html)

3 different graphical libraries are also implemented:

- [Ncurses](https://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ncurses/)
- [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/Installation)
- [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php)

## Usage

### Building program

Arcade is a B-OOP-400 EPITECH module project.
It is build with Makefile.

You can use this program as it follows:

```textmate
$> make
// Build the entire programm

$> make core
// Build the core programm

$> make graphics
// Build the different libraries

$> make games
// Build the different games

```

You can also launch unit tests by using the command below at root of the repository:

```textmate
$> make tests_run
// Compile and launch test binary
$> make coverage
// Show the code coverage
```

### Launch program

Launch Arcade by giving in argument the graphical library you want to use.\
Don't worry you can change it in the menu.

The library must be in a ```/lib``` folder at the **root** of the project.

```
$> ./arcade ./lib/[LIBRARY_NAME].so
```
